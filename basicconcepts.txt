Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not have complex features
like Operator overloading, Multiple inheritance, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.
Java code that is written on one machine can run on another machine. 
The platform independent byte code can be carried to any platform for
execution that makes java code portable.

Variables in Java:
A variable is a name which is associated with a value that can be changed.
For example when I write int i=10; here variable name is i which is associated
with value 10, int is a data type that represents that this variable can hold integer values.
We will cover the data types in the next tutorial. In this tutorial, we will discuss about variables.

To declare a variable follow this syntax:
data_type variable_name = value;
int num;
char ch = 'A';
int number = 100;

we can do it like this:
char ch;
int number;
...
ch = 'A';
number  = 100;

Primitive data types
byte, short, int and long data types are used for storing whole numbers.
float and double are used for fractional numbers.
char is used for storing characters(letters).
boolean data type is used for variables that holds either true or false.

byte: This can hold whole number between -128 and 127.
Default size of this data type: 1 byte.

short: This is greater than byte in terms of size and less than integer. Its range is -32,768 to 32767.
Default size of this data type: 2 byte

int: Used when short is not large enough to hold the number, it has a wider range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
Default size: 4 byte

long: Used when int is not large enough to hold the value, it has wider range than int data type,
ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. size: 8 bytes

float: Sufficient for holding 6 to 7 decimal digits size: 4 bytes
double: Sufficient for holding 15 decimal digits size: 8 bytes
boolean: holds either true of false.
char: holds characters. size: 2 bytes

Closer look to the First Java Program

public static void main(String[] args)  {
System.out.println("This is my first program in java");
}

lets break it down to understand it:
public: This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.
static: We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.
void: It does not return anything.
main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.
(String[] args): Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.
