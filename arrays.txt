An array is a collection of variables of the same type. In Java arrays are objects.
When you need to store a list of values, such as numbers, you can store them in an array, instead of declaring separate variables for each number.

To declare an array, you need to define the type of the elements with square brackets.
For example, to declare an array of integers:
int[ ] arr;

The name of the array is arr. The type of elements it will hold is int.

Now, you need to define the array's capacity, or the number of elements it will hold. To accomplish this, use the keyword new.
int[ ] arr = new int[5];

The code above declares an array of 5 integers.
In an array, the elements are ordered and each has a specific and constant position, which is called an index.

To reference elements in an array, type the name of the array followed by the index position within a pair of square brackets.
Example:
arr[2] = 42;

This assigns a value of 42 to the element with 2 as its index.
There is another way to declare array: int a[]={33,3,4,5};
