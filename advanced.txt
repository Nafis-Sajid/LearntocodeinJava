Java API:
The Java API is a collection of classes and interfaces that have been written for you to use.
Once you locate the package you want to use, you need to import it into your code.
The package can be imported using the import keyword.
For example:

The awt package contains all of the classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images.
